# Preparations

This directory contains various components and tools for working with text and object detection, language models, and attention mechanisms. Below you'll find information about each component and how to use them.

## Project Structure

- `open-clip-attention/`: Implementation of attention mechanisms using OpenCLIP for generating bounding box of objects and their masks.
- `Text Object Detection/`: Tools for identifying objects in text using LLaMA 3
- `Lang-Sam/`: Language-guided Segment Anything Model implementation
- `Reorder Text Objects/`: Tools for reordering detected text objects
- `Text Object Replacement/`: Tools for replacing detected text objects

## Prerequisites

Before using these components, ensure you have:
1. Python 3.8 or higher installed
2. Required dependencies (specific requirements for each component can be found in their respective section)
3. Sufficient GPU resources for running the models

## Usage Instructions

### Open CLIP Attention

#### requirements
1. [Language Segment-Anything](https://github.com/luca-medeiros/lang-segment-anything)
2. [OpenCLIP](https://github.com/mlfoundations/open_clip)
3. Follow their instruction to setup a enviroment

The `open-clip-attention` module provides attention mechanisms for processing visual and textual data:

1. Navigate to the directory:
```bash
cd open-clip-attention
```

2. The directory contains two Jupyter notebooks:
   - `Groundino-attentional.ipynb`: Implementation of attention mechanisms
   - `visualize.ipynb`: Visualization tools for attention patterns

3. To use the notebooks:
   - Ensure Jupyter is installed: `pip install jupyter`
   - Start Jupyter: `jupyter notebook`
   - Open either notebook in your browser

### LLaMA 3 Core Implementation

The `llama3` directory contains the core LLaMA 3 model implementation:

1. Navigate to the directory:
```bash
cd llama3
```

2. The main implementation is in `llama3.ipynb`:
   - This notebook contains the core LLaMA 3 model setup and usage
   - Make sure you have the required model weights (see Prerequisites section)
   - Use Jupyter to open and run the notebook

### Identifying Objects in Text

To identify objects in text using LLaMA 3:

1. Navigate to the directory:
```bash
cd Identifing\ Objects\ in\ Text\ via\ llama3
```

2. Follow the component's setup instructions

### Lang-SAM Integration

For language-guided object segmentation:

1. Navigate to the directory:
```bash
cd Lang-Sam
```

2. Follow the setup instructions in the component's README

### Text Object Operations

For reordering and replacing text objects:

1. Navigate to either:
```bash
cd Reorder\ Text\ Objects
# or
cd Text\ Object\ Replacement
```

2. Follow the specific component's instructions
